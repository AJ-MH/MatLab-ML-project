# MATLAB-ML Project

This repository contains MATLAB codes and data used for Spectral method and Machine Learning based multi-classification of Myocardial Infarction Cardiac diseases.

## Features
* Healthy control and 4 MI (Anterior, Antero-Lateral, Antero-Septal and Inferior) datasets
* Implements spectral(SWT, DWT, WPD, ST) and nonlinear methods (entropies) on preprocessed ECG signals
* Machine learning models for classification

## Requirements
* MATLAB R2023a or later
* Signal processing Toolbox

## Usage
1. Clone the repo
2. Open MATLAB
3. Run 'main.m'
